## Project Idea: RGB LED Color Controller

**Description**: This project involves controlling an RGB LED's color using the mouse position on a canvas displayed by p5.js. The mouse's X and Y positions are mapped to RGB values, which are then sent to the Arduino via serial communication. The Arduino receives these values and adjusts the brightness of the LED's red, green, and blue components using PWM. This creates a seamless interaction between the virtual and physical systems, where the LED replicates the color displayed on the screen in real-time.

    \node[below of=arduino, yshift=-1cm] (led) {RGB LED Output};
    \node[above of=p5js, yshift=1cm] (mouse) {Mouse Position};

    % Connections

    \draw[->] (mouse) -- (p5js);
    \draw[->] (arduino) -- (led);
\end{tikzpicture}

### p5.js:
- **Input**: Mouse position (X, Y) on the canvas.
- **Output**: Sends RGB values to Arduino.

### Arduino:
- **Input**: RGB values from p5.js via serial communication.
- **Output**: Controls the RGB LED with PWM to reflect the color.

# Idea 2

## Project Idea: Proximity-Based LED Visualizer

**Description**: This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of an object, and based on the proximity, LEDs light up in different patterns and intensities. The distance data is sent to p5.js, which visualizes the proximity in real-time with animations like expanding circles or bars. The closer the object, the brighter the LEDs and the more dynamic the visualizations, creating a rich interactive system.

# Idea 3

## Project Idea: Touchless Light Controller

**Description**: This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to create a touchless light controller. The distance of a user's hand from the sensor determines the brightness and color of an LED. The proximity data is sent to p5.js, where a visual bar or gradient dynamically represents the LED's brightness and color. As the user moves their hand closer or farther, the LED changes in intensity and hue, with the screen showing a synchronized visualization.
